**Minion** üçå is a worker/dispatcher package for distributing jobs across a number of workers. The dispatcher creates the workers and is used to enqueue jobs, using either a blocking or non-blocking function. The incoming jobs are distributed to the available workers.

This package is strongly inspired by Marcio Castilho's blog post, [Handling 1 Million Requests per Minute with Go](http://marcio.io/2015/07/handling-1-million-requests-per-minute-with-golang/).

## Creating jobs

A job is created by implementing the `Job` interface:

``` go
type Job interface {
	// Perform runs the job.
	Perform()
}
```

The implementing struct can contain whatever additional fields it needs to perform the job, as seen in the example below.

## Creating the dispatcher

The dispatcher takes two arguments: the number of workers, and the length of the job queue.

``` go
// Create dispatcher/queue with five workers and a queue size of 10
dispatcher := minion.NewDispatcher(5, 10)

// Start the dispatcher and wait for jobs
dispatcher.Run()
```

## Blocking vs non-blocking

The job enqueueing can be either blocking or non-blocking, as required. The non-blocking call can be used to return a HTTP status if the service is at capacity or similar.

``` go
// Blocking call
dispatcher.Enqueue(job)

// Non-blocking call
if ok := dispatcher.TryEnqueue(job); !ok {
    // Job queue is full
    return http.StatusServiceUnavailable
}
```

## Example

``` go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"

    "github.com/jsvensson/minion"
)

func main() {
    // Create dispatcher/queue with five workers and a queue size of 10
    dispatcher := minion.NewDispatcher(5, 10)

    // Start the dispatcher
    dispatcher.Run()

    // Timer and waitgroup to sync job completion
    start := time.Now()
    wg := &sync.WaitGroup{}

    // Create 50 calculation jobs
    for i := 1; i <= 50; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        fmt.Println("Creating job", i)
        job := Calculation{i, wg}
        
        // Add job to queue, blocks if the job queue is full
        dispatcher.Enqueue(job)
    }

    // Wait for all jobs to finish
    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Printf("Jobs executed in %.3f seconds\n", time.Since(start).Seconds())
}

// Calculation implements the Job interface so it can be sent to the job queue.
type Calculation struct {
    Value int
    wg    *sync.WaitGroup
}

// Perform runs the calculation job.
func (c Calculation) Perform() {
    // Do some time-consuming math
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    result := c.Value * c.Value

    fmt.Printf("Calculation %d done, result: %d\n", c.Value, result)
    c.wg.Done()
}
```
